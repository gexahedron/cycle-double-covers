#[Unit vector flows](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/unit_vector_flows)

##Main result here (as of May 18, 2016)
There is a configuration of 30 points on the sphere, which don't have a nowhere-zero 4-flow (but they still have a nowhere-zero 5-flow). Actually, these 30 points are the vertices of [icosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosidodecahedron) and triplets of points are connected as a Petersen graph.
